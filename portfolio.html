                <h3>Drone Connections</h3>
                <p class="p2-1">In the Summer of 2023, I had the privilege of interning for Eve Vehicles, a drone
                    startup affiliated with the University of Texas Center for Electromechanics (CEM). Working in a
                    professional development environment was an entirely new experience for me. It wasn't a typical
                    internship, I was given lots of freedom to solve the problems the team was facing, which was super
                    exciting! This was difficult in the beginning because I didn't have much experience with the
                    technologies they
                    were using. I wanted to avoid weighing down a team that had much more work than they had employees
                    (the engineering team was 3 people!). I am proud that I was
                    able to become self-sufficient in the technologies being used, and made concrete contributions to
                    the future of the project. I constructed the whole pipeline of flight log retrieval, which spanned
                    from automating the log retrieval from the flight controller's companion computer to adding features
                    to the UI that allowed for easy and efficient access to the logs.</p>

                <h3>Store Management System</h3>
                <p class="p2-1">I took a class in databases (CSCE 310) last semester, and I gained a lot of insight into
                    the
                    importance and types of data management in applications. For my final project, I created a store
                    management system and its associated GUI for accessible modification and viewing of the database's
                    contents. The GUI included customer and employee views, so it could handle operations involving both
                    of those groups. Customer operations included placing orders, which would then update the inventory
                    accessible through the employee view. The employee view allowed for the management of inventory,
                    staffing, suppliers, customers, and other relevant categories. The system was structured so that my
                    Java program would execute queries on my database, which integrated Redis, based on user input. I
                    used a docker
                    container to set up and
                    maintain a web server, which generated an html page containing the query results. The results could
                    be viewed in either the application or online. Implementing this project taught me more about the
                    relationships between the front and back-end of application development, and strengthened my
                    knowledge of database management.</p>
